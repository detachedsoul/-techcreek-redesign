# TechCreek website redesign

As part of the Codegaminator 9.0 program organized by Rivers State ICT department, (Riv-TechCreek), we were assigned a task to redesign their existing website as part of our project work. While I am not a UI designer, the aim of the project was to test our capabilities in what we've been thought, mainly React, and backend development using MongoDB, NodeJs, and ExpressJs. This is my attempt to complete the task.

The live demo of this project can be found on [techcreek.vercel.app](https://techcreek.vercel.app)
