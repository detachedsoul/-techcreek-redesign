                <p>
                    The CODEGAMINATORSâ€™ programme was initiated to skill-up our youths in the fundamentals of the ICT content industry. The content industry (in software, games, animations, movies, music, education, health etc) accounts for over $30BN worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As part of our mandate to ensure the right capacities are developed in the Information and Communication Technology sector of the Economy, we have this programme designed to build capacities in software and digital content development. Our focus with this programme is Software Development, Animations/Post production and Game Development.
